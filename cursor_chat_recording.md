## 2026-06-20 — PR review/merge restrictions

**User:** Wants to be the only person able to review and merge PRs. Also needs this to work for existing PRs.

**User follow-up:** Gets message that the PR creator cannot review the PR.

**Diagnosis:**
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` already assigns all files to `@meleantonio`.
- Branch protection required code-owner review (`require_code_owner_reviews: true`) with `enforce_admins: true`.
- GitHub does not allow PR authors to approve their own PRs.
- With only one code owner who also authors PRs, merges were blocked.

**Fix applied (GitHub branch protection on `main`):**
- Set `enforce_admins: false` so repository admin (`meleantonio`) can merge without self-approval.
- Kept code-owner review requirement for participant PRs (only `@meleantonio` can satisfy approvals).
- Personal repos cannot use user-based bypass/restriction lists via API.

**Note:** Self-approval is still impossible on GitHub; owner merges via admin bypass instead.

## 2026-06-21 — Day 1 slides PDF added

- **Action:** Copied instructor `slides/day1/day1_slides.pdf` to `slides/day1_slides.pdf` for participant access.
- **Automation:** Instructor repo hook (`.cursor/hooks.json`) will prompt Composer to re-sync this file when the source Day 1 PDF is updated.

## 2026-06-21 — Day 1 slides aligned with GUIDE.md

- **Action:** Refactored Day 1 slides from instructor source to match `GUIDE.md` pedagogical sequence and Day 1 content.
- **New slide topics:** agent ownership boundaries, `GUIDE.md` reference, Day 1 schedule-at-a-glance, project brief section, first safe issue, Day 1 exercises.
- **File:** `slides/day1_slides.pdf` (48 pages).

## 2026-06-22 — Issue #17: SDD skill and orchestrator bundled

- **Source:** Instructor repo issue #17 (epic #15).
- **Added:** `.cursor/skills/sdd/` (SKILL.md, reference.md, templates/), `.cursor/agents/sdd-orchestrator.md`
- **Portable copies:** `agent-harness/skills/sdd/`, `agent-harness/subagents/sdd-orchestrator.md`
- **Template:** `templates/spec/intent.md` (economics research intent stub)
- **Docs:** `days/day2.md`, `agent-harness/README.md`, `tool-lanes/cursor.md`
- **Verification:** `python3 -m pytest examples/mini-economics/tests` — 3 passed
